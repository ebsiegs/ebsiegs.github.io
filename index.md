[Classifying Passive vs. Active Revenge in Related Subreddits using NLP](https://github.com/ebsiegs/subreddit_nlp.git)

*This project uses and evaluates a variety of classification models including Logistic Regression, regularized Lasso Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes in order to model the distinction between active and passive revenge in the related subreddits: r/MaliciousCompliance, r/ProRevenge, and r/pettyrevenge.*

[Predicting Ames, Iowa Real Estate Prices with Linear Regression](https://github.com/ebsiegs/housing_price_prediction)

*In this project I built a regression model that predicts home sale prices in Ames, Iowa given an input file with 80 columns of different home features and about 2,050 homes. I set out to try and identify what those major factors are for homes on the market in Ames, in addition to predicting Sale Price for those homes.*
