# Projects

## [Starbucks Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering](/projects/starbucks_customer_segmentation.md)
*For this group project, my collaborators and I utilized convolutional neural networks to build multiple Breast Cancer tumor detection models from two different mammogram datasets.*

## [Classifying Passive vs. Active Revenge in Related Subreddits using NLP](/projects/subreddit_nlp.md)
*This project uses and evaluates a variety of classification models including Logistic Regression, regularized Lasso Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes in order to model the distinction between active and passive revenge in the related subreddits: r/MaliciousCompliance, r/ProRevenge, and r/pettyrevenge.*

## [Predicting Ames, Iowa Real Estate Prices with Linear Regression](/projects/housing_price_prediction.md)
*In this project I built a regression model that predicts home sale prices in Ames, Iowa given an input file with 80 columns of different home features and about 2,050 homes. I set out to try and identify what those major factors are for homes on the market in Ames, in addition to predicting Sale Price for those homes.*
